...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!,angry,,,,,,

Uh-huh.,neutral,,,,,,
"I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought fearful me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.",happy,,,,,,
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.,neutral,,,,,,
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.,neutral,,,,,,

Yes.,neutral,,,,,,
"Does he, uh, fight with other animals?",fearful,,,,,,
"No-no, he's, he's very docile.",neutral,,,,,,
Even if he were... cornered?,neutral,,,,,,
"Well I, I don't know. Why?",neutral,,,,,,
"Uh, how is he at handling small objects?",neutral,,,,,,
"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...",neutral,,,,,,
"How about a hammer, or a small blade?",neutral,,,,,,
Why- why- why would he need a blade?,fearful,,,,,,
"Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.",neutral,,,,,,

"That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?",neutral,,,,,,
Five years.,neutral,,,,,,
You've sentenced him?!,fearful,,,,,,
Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.,happy,,,,,,
"Joey, the guy's your best friend.",happy,,,,,,

"Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.",happy,,,,,,
"Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...",happy,,,,,,
"Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.",happy,,,,,,
"Really? Well, in that case...",fearful,,,,,,
And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.,fearful,,,,,,
"That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.",happy,,,,,,

"Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.",happy,,,,,,
"Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.",happy,,,,,,
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?,happy,,,,,,

Oh yeah!,neutral,,,,,,
"Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.",neutral,,,,,,
Really?,fearful,,,,,,
